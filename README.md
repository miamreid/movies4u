# movies4u

For users that are tired of scrolling through Netflix, Hulu, Disney+ and more, the Movies4U app is the one-stop for getting movie recommendations based on genre, ratings, and most popular movies. 

The Movies4U app recommends movies for users that are tired of mindlessly scrolling through their multiple streaming platforms. By just entering a genre, decade (for nostalgic purposes), and length of the movie (because we don’t always need to watch the Lord of the Rings (Extended Version) series), Movies4U will show users the top rated movies matching their criteria. <br />

After applying your selections, displays multiple movies to watch, and each links to its own page displaying a a synopsis and reviews of the movie you choose.
